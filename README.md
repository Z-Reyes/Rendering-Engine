# Rendering-Engine
A rendering engine I wrote up when was I learning computer graphics. It has material support, shadow casting, and texture support.

Most of the textures used in the main of this program came from outside sources and have thus been removed either for privacy or copyright reasons. This basically means you can't just download the program and run it right away. You'd have to change the textures some of the objects refer to.
